## Goal

This application demonstrates how to integrate with AdAway using broadcasted intents.
For developers, the source code must be simple enough for developers to read and appropriate how to use it (See [MainActivity](app/src/main/java/org/adaway/automation/MainActivity.java)).
For users, it must allow to integrate with their favorite automation application without having to require them to use the AdAway custom permmission.

## Non goal

This application is not intended to be have a well polished user interface or be translated in a lot of language.
AdAway documentation should provide the related documentation instead.
